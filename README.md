# Integraton_pgsql_python_tableau_project
Data analytics project deals with PostgreSQL, Python and Tableau.
Initially started by analysing the key outcomes from this project checking for datasets and downloading them from Kaggle
Basic data manipulation with MS Excel.
Import that data into pgadmin(SQL) to apply advanced manipulation and generate insights from it.
Mainly covered many SQL concepts, performed data manipulation, generated different tables here, and finally used main_cars table for Python integration.
Integrated PostgreSQL with Python and performed data cleaning and EDA process on it and applied regression algorithms to it.
Applied regression algorithms and get insights from this and check the algorithm by passing random data to it.
After that created reports and dashboards using Tableau for better visualizations.
